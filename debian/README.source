The sources of this package are managed with debdry. This means that the git
repository does contain a full debian/ directory, but only the bits that are
needed on top of the auto-debianisation done by stdeb, which is called by
debdry for Python packages.

To build, you can use the git-debdry-build helper provided with debdry >= 0.2.
See git-debdry-build(1) for details on how it works.
